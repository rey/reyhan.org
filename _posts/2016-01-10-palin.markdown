[Palin](https://github.com/rey/palin) is an app for your menu bar that
shows a green dot when you have an internet connection, or a red dot if you
don't have an internet connection.

Download the latest version [here](https://www.strongspace.com/rey/public/Palin.zip).

I built Palin for two reasons:

1. I tether using my iPhone on the commute to work -- the internet is often
flaky and I regularly find myself opening a terminal and running `ping
8.8.8.8`.
2. The wifi card on my work machine is rather troublesome, so it's
nice to have the internet status available at a glance.

Palin is named for [Michael Palin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Palin),
whose television travel series [Around the World in 80
Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Palin:_Around_the_World_in_80_Days)
happened to be television the night before I decided to build it.
