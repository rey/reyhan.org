**TL;DR** Creating an **encrypted** iOS backup in iTunes _will_ back up your accounts
held in Google Authenticator.

Having suffered performance issues with the iOS 11.1.1 update, I decided to
restore my iPhone to factory settings but was concerned that I would lose the
accounts held in [Google
Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-authenticator/id388497605).

I'm happy to report that if you create an [Encrypted iPhone backup in
iTunes](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205220) then all the accounts in
Google Authenticator will be backed up, and will be present and correct when you
restore your iPhone from your backup.
